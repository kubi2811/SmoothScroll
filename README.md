A lightweight utility for buttery smooth scrolling in web browsers on Windows.

## Installation & Usage

1.  **Download**: Get the latest `BrowserSmoothScroll.exe` (Single File or Standard folder).
    *   *Recommended*: Use the **Single File** version for portability.
2.  **Run**: Double-click `BrowserSmoothScroll.exe`.
3.  **Setup**:
    *   The app runs in the **System Tray** (near the clock).
    *   Right-click the tray icon to **Enable/Disable** or access **Settings**.
    *   **Auto-Start**: Enabled by default (configurable in Settings).

> **Tip**: Disable "Smooth Scrolling" in your browser (`chrome://flags/#smooth-scrolling` or `edge://flags/#smooth-scrolling`) to avoid double-smoothing effects.

## Uninstall

*   Simply delete the `.exe` file (and the folder if you used the Standard version).
*   Settings are stored in `%APPDATA%\BrowserSmoothScroll` and can be deleted if desired.
